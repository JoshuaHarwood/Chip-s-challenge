# SWEN225 Group Project

What we need by Monday:
The repository has commits by all team members. 
There are test cases to check game logic
There is a working stable playable prototype that allows game play 

The prototype may have one or many of the following limitations: 
*  the advanced components are missing
*  only level one is implemented
*  the game timeout functionality is missing
